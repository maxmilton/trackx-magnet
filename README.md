# trackx-harvester ![](./static/icon48.png)

Browser extension to collect error and ping data samples for [TrackX](https://github.com/maxmilton/trackx) development. The extension injects the [trackx client](https://github.com/maxmilton/trackx/tree/master/packages/client) into all web visited pages, except those with a URL or title which match a word in a curated block list (for user privacy).

Event reports can be viewed at <https://dash.trackx.app/projects/trackx-harvester>.
